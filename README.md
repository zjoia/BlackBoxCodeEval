Black Box Code Unit Test Evaluation
===================================

This project is a self contained system used for testing a prospective developer's ability
to work in the Black Box Code Test Driven Design paradigm.

It is not intended to be fully functioning, and only dependencies required to complete
the assignment have been included. Scope and visibility have been intentionally obscured.

What's inside?
--------------

This repository contains all the resources necessary for you to fulfill your two part evaluation:

* Write code to make two out of the five existing unit tests located in TestBundle/Tests/Gateway/CriterionType pass.
  Please see method descriptions for further instruction on the intended use of this code.

* Optionally create unit tests for the code stubs located in TestBundle/Adjustment based on the UML diagram
  that should have been provided to you in association with this assignment. You are not required
  to get these tests to pass, only to write them. They should run and fail or error but not fatal.

Don't get too hung up on the second assignment, Black Box Code needs developers of all levels, and if this
task feels too daunting then feel free to skip it.

How do I begin?
---------------

* Create a branch off the main repository named after yourself.
* Complete the assignments laid out above.
* This is a timed evaluation, your commit time will be noted
* DO NOT commit to master.

What do I do if I have questions?
---------------------------------

We strive for this process to be fairly self explanatory, but if you do have questions please ask them.

You may contact us at developertest@blackboxcode.com.

Thank you for your interest in becoming part of the Black Box Code team!

Black Box Code Unit Test Evaluation
===================================

This project is a self contained system used for testing a prospective developer's ability
to work in the Black Box Code Test Driven Design paradigm.

It is not intended to be fully functioning, and only dependencies required to complete
the assignment have been included. Scope and visibility have been intentionally obscured.

What's inside?
--------------

This repository contains all the resources necessary for you to fulfill your two part evaluation:

* Write code to make the existing unit tests located in TestBundle/Tests/Gateway pass.
  There are notes in the code indicating what the methods should do.

* Create unit tests for the code stubs located in TestBundle/Adjustment/* based on the UML diagram
  that should have been provided to you in association with this assignment. You are not required
  to get these tests to pass, only to write them. In fact the unit test should run and fail or error but not fatal.

How do I begin?
-------------

* Create a branch off the main repository named after yourself.
* Complete the assignments laid out above.
* Commit your work to your branch within 4 hours of receiving this evaluation.
* DO NOT commit to master.

What do I do if I have questions?
---------------------------------

We strive for this process to be fairly self explanatory, but if you do have questions please ask them.

You may contact us at developertest@blackboxcode.com.

Thank you for your interest in becoming part of the Black Box Code team!
